# Overview: Germline short variant discovery (SNPs + Indels)

This directory contains markdown and bash commands following the GATK's best practices for (germline short variant discovery)[https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-].

# Usage

All of the bash commands in are expected to be executed from within the GATK docker container, which
can be run using the below command:

```commandline
mkdir -p /data/Genomics
docker run -ti -v /data/Genomics:/data broadinstitute/gatk:4.2.6.1 /bin/bash
```

This operation will run the container in interactive mode, giving a bash shell, mounting the local path /data/Genomics to the container path /data.
